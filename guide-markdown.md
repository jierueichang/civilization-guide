# A Simple Guide for Creating a Civilization
By Jieruei Chang, 2020 AD

So. A global catastrophe - nuclear war, famine, nanobots, global warming, the sun going nova - has finally occurred. You’ve somehow survived, but anarchy is rife and murder rates spike as survivors fight in the struggle to find canned food.

This guide will hopefully help guide you to rebuild society, avoid being killed, and become leader - ruthless dictator or wise emperor - of your new civilization.

Firstly, you will need to find fertile ground to build a civilization. Chances are, your planet isn’t habitable anymore. If possible, move to another planet in the near vicinity. This can be accomplished relatively easily by putting people in a rocket, which is in essence a large, tall can packed with exploding stuff. A well constructed rocket will not explode; the exploding stuff will burn, producing gases and smoke that shoot very fast out of the end of the rocket. This makes the rocket go up very fast. If the rocket goes fast enough, it will reach the escape velocity of your dead planetary system. If you point the rocket in the right direction, you can steer it towards another planet. I hope that you remembered to bring parachutes.

If your star system has no viable planetary systems, you can try to colonize a planet in another star system. This is also relatively easy; just build an Alcubierre drive, warp space-time and you’ll find yourself at your destination in no time at all. I’m not exactly sure how it works, so I’m not going to talk about this any more.

After you find somewhere to build a civilization, you will need to ascertain yourself as ruler of the population. The simplest method of doing this is to feed people. If you feed people, then they won’t be hungry and will be happy. If people are happy, they are less likely to object to you calling yourself the king.

However, to feed people, you will need food. If you have leftover canned food, now is the time to use it. If you have used up all your canned food and emergency rations, you can introduce a concept known as farming.

Farming is simple. You put things called seeds - little boxes filled with energy and genetic material - into the ground, dump dihydrogen monoxide on them, and wait several months. The seeds will transmute into tall-ish green things called plants. Please note that plants are not planets, no matter how similar their words look. As far as I know, you cannot grow planets. Anyway, plants are usually edible, though some are poisonous. Before eating a plant, make sure that it isn’t poisonous. If you eat a poisonous plant, you could get sick or die.

And that’s how you run a civilization: find someplace nice, feed your people, and proclaim yourself as ruler. Oh, and don’t be mean to your people. That’s only going to get you killed faster.
